<h1>Attention Enhanced Future Frame Prediction for Video Anomaly Detection</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
Video anomaly detection in surveillance environments is challenging due to the scarcity of abnormal events,
lack of frame-level annotations, and the subtle nature of behaviors such as theft.
Prediction-based approaches address this problem by learning normal spatio-temporal patterns through
future-frame prediction and detecting anomalies as deviations between predicted and actual frames.
However, most existing methods rely heavily on pixel-level prediction errors, which are sensitive to noise
and often fail to capture localized and subtle abnormal activities.
</p>

<p>
To address these limitations, we propose an <b>attention-enhanced future-frame prediction framework</b>
for unsupervised video anomaly detection.
The proposed model integrates a spatio-temporal attention mechanism into a CNN–ConvLSTM–decoder
architecture, enabling the network to focus on behavior-relevant regions and critical temporal segments.
In addition, anomaly scoring is performed using a combination of pixel-level and feature-level discrepancies,
resulting in improved robustness to noise and enhanced sensitivity to subtle theft-like behaviors.
The model is trained solely on normal data and does not require explicit anomaly annotations.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Additional / Unique Features Added</h2>

<h3>1. Spatio-Temporal Attention Mechanism</h3>
<p>
Most prediction-based anomaly detection models treat all spatial regions and temporal frames equally.
In practice, abnormal behaviors such as theft are localized (e.g., hand–object interactions) and occur
over short time intervals.
</p>

<p>
The proposed spatio-temporal attention module assigns higher importance to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regions with significant motion or interaction</li>
  <li>Temporal segments where behavior changes abruptly</li>
</ul>

<p>
By suppressing static background regions and emphasizing behavior-relevant areas,
the attention mechanism enables the model to concentrate its predictive capacity where anomalies are
most likely to occur.
</p>

<h3>2. Feature-Level Anomaly Scoring</h3>
<p>
Existing methods primarily rely on pixel-level metrics (e.g., PSNR or MSE) to compute anomaly scores.
Such metrics are sensitive to illumination changes, camera noise, and minor background variations.
</p>

<p>
To overcome this limitation, the proposed framework introduces feature-level discrepancy by comparing
deep representations of predicted and actual frames.
These representations encode semantic and motion information, making them more robust to noise.
</p>

<p>
The final anomaly score is computed by combining:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pixel-level prediction error (captures large deviations)</li>
  <li>Feature-level discrepancy (captures subtle behavioral changes)</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Effect of the Added Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Improved Sensitivity to Subtle Anomalies:</b>
      Attention highlights small but meaningful motion patterns that pixel-level errors may overlook.</li>

  <li><b>Reduced False Positives:</b>
      Background motion and illumination changes are downweighted, leading to fewer spurious detections.</li>

  <li><b>Better Behavioral Modeling:</b>
      Feature-level comparison captures semantic inconsistencies rather than raw pixel noise.</li>

  <li><b>Lightweight Design:</b>
      The added modules introduce minimal computational overhead compared to memory banks or diffusion models.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Component-wise Description</h3>

<h4>CNN Encoder</h4>
<p>
The CNN encoder processes each input frame independently and extracts spatial features such as edges,
object shapes, and local motion cues.
This step transforms raw pixel input into a compact and semantically meaningful representation.
</p>

<h4>ConvLSTM</h4>
<p>
ConvLSTM layers model the temporal evolution of spatial features across consecutive frames.
They learn normal motion dynamics and interaction patterns present in surveillance scenes.
Abnormal events disrupt these learned temporal regularities.
</p>

<h4>Spatio-Temporal Attention Module</h4>
<p>
The attention module operates on ConvLSTM feature maps and assigns adaptive weights across spatial
and temporal dimensions.
Regions and frames contributing more to behavioral changes receive higher weights,
guiding the decoder toward important motion patterns.
</p>

<h4>Decoder</h4>
<p>
The decoder reconstructs the predicted future frame using attended spatio-temporal features.
Accurate prediction indicates normal behavior, while poor prediction indicates abnormal activity.
</p>

<h4>Anomaly Scoring</h4>
<p>
During inference, the predicted frame is compared with the actual frame at both pixel and feature levels.
The combined discrepancy serves as the anomaly score, with higher values indicating abnormal events.

<h1> Detailed Description </h1>
<h2>1. What is your project about? (Big Picture)</h2>

<p>
Your project is about video anomaly detection in surveillance videos, with a specific interest in subtle behaviors like theft.
</p>

<p>
In simple terms:
</p>

<p>
You want a system that learns what normal behavior looks like in a surveillance scene and raises an alert when something unexpected or abnormal (like theft) happens — without needing labeled anomaly data.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>2. Why is this problem hard?</h2>

<p>
From your literature survey, the main challenges are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Anomalies are rare</b>
    <ul>
      <li>You don’t have enough theft videos to train supervised models.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Theft is subtle</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Small hand movements, object interaction, short duration.</li>
      <li>Not big visual changes like explosions or accidents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>No clear labels</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Most real surveillance data is unlabeled.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Existing methods fail here</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Pixel-level errors detect large anomalies but miss subtle ones.</li>
      <li>Background noise causes false alarms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>3. How does the literature solve this problem?</h2>

<p>
Most papers you studied follow this idea:
</p>

<p>
<b>👉 Future-frame prediction paradigm</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Core idea:</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Train a model only on normal videos</li>
  <li>The model learns to predict the next frame</li>
  <li>If the future frame cannot be predicted well → anomaly</li>
</ul>

<p>
This works because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normal behavior is predictable</li>
  <li>Abnormal behavior is not</li>
</ul>

<p>
This paradigm is used in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liu et al. 2018</li>
  <li>Zhu et al. 2019</li>
  <li>Memory-augmented methods</li>
  <li>Distillation methods</li>
  <li>Hybrid prediction–reconstruction methods</li>
</ul>

<p>
So you are not inventing a new paradigm — you are building on a well-accepted one.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>4. What is the main problem with existing methods?</h2>

<p>
From your table, the same limitations repeat again and again:
</p>

<p>
<b>❌ Pixel-level anomaly scoring (PSNR, MSE)</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensitive to lighting, shadows, camera noise</li>
  <li>Treats background and action equally</li>
  <li>Misses subtle theft-like actions</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>❌ No focus mechanism</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Model looks at the whole frame equally</li>
  <li>Theft happens in small regions, not everywhere</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>❌ Heavy solutions exist</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Memory banks</li>
  <li>Diffusion models</li>
  <li>Teacher–student frameworks</li>
</ul>

<p>
But they are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computationally expensive</li>
  <li>Hard to train</li>
  <li>Overkill for your goal</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>5. What is YOUR idea? (Core contribution)</h2>

<p>
You keep the future-frame prediction framework, but you fix its weakness.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your idea is:</b>
</p>

<p>
Add intelligence to prediction-based anomaly detection by guiding the model to focus on important spatial and temporal regions and by improving anomaly scoring beyond raw pixel error.
</p>

<p>
That’s it.<br/>
Simple, clear, strong.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>6. What exactly are you adding? (Unique features)</h2>

<p>
You add two key things — nothing more, nothing less.
</p>

<h3>6.1 Spatio-Temporal Attention (MOST IMPORTANT)</h3>

<p>
<b>What it is</b>
</p>

<p>
A lightweight module that tells the model:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where to look (spatial attention)</li>
  <li>When to care (temporal attention)</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Why it is needed</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Theft happens in localized regions</li>
  <li>Background motion should not dominate the score</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>What it fixes</b>
</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <th>Problem</th>
    <th>Fixed by Attention</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Background noise</td>
    <td>Suppressed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Subtle hand/object motion</td>
    <td>Highlighted</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>False positives</td>
    <td>Reduced</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Why this is safe and valid</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attention is already accepted in VAD literature</li>
  <li>You are using it in a new place (prediction-based framework)</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 Feature-Level Anomaly Scoring</h3>

<p>
<b>What it is</b>
</p>

<p>
Instead of comparing only pixels, you also compare:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deep feature representations of predicted vs real frames</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Why this matters</b>
</p>

<p>
Features encode:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Motion patterns</li>
  <li>Semantics</li>
</ul>

<p>
Less sensitive to illumination and noise
</p>

<p>
<b>What it fixes</b>

<h2>7. What is the full architecture? (Clear explanation)</h2>

<p>
Here is exactly what happens, step by step.
</p>

<h3>Step 1: Input frames</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Take last N frames (e.g., 4–5)</li>
  <li>This gives temporal context</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step 2: CNN Encoder</h3>
<p>
Extract spatial features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Edges</li>
  <li>Motion cues</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?<br/>
Pixels are noisy; features are meaningful.
</p>

<h3>Step 3: ConvLSTM</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Processes features across time</li>
  <li>Learns normal temporal evolution</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?<br/>
Normal behavior follows predictable patterns.
</p>

<h3>Step 4: Spatio-Temporal Attention (YOUR KEY MODULE)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Weighs ConvLSTM features</li>
  <li>Focuses on:
    <ul>
      <li>Moving objects</li>
      <li>Interaction zones</li>
      <li>Critical time steps</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?<br/>
Theft is small and localized.
</p>

<h3>Step 5: Decoder</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Predicts the next frame</li>
  <li>Uses attended features</li>
</ul>

<p>
Why?<br/>
Prediction enforces learning of normal behavior.
</p>

<h3>Step 6: Anomaly Scoring</h3>

<p>
You compute:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pixel-level error</li>
  <li>Feature-level discrepancy</li>
</ul>

<p>
Then combine them into a final anomaly score.
</p>

<p>
High score → anomaly<br/>
Low score → normal
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>8. Training vs Testing (VERY IMPORTANT)</h2>

<h3>Training</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only normal videos</li>
  <li>No theft labels</li>
  <li>Model learns normality</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unseen videos (may contain theft)</li>
  <li>Prediction fails when abnormal behavior appears</li>
  <li>Attention highlights abnormal regions</li>
  <li>Score spikes</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is unsupervised anomaly detection.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>9. What you are NOT doing (important clarity)</h2>

<p>
You are not:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing supervised classification</li>
  <li>Using reinforcement learning</li>
  <li>Using diffusion or CLIP</li>
  <li>Building heavy multi-task systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
This keeps your work:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean</li>
  <li>Explainable</li>
  <li>Reproducible</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>10. What is your final contribution (clear & defensible)</h2>

<p>
You can confidently claim:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An attention-enhanced future-frame prediction framework</li>
  <li>Improved anomaly scoring using feature-level discrepancy</li>
  <li>Better detection of subtle theft-like anomalies</li>
  <li>Lightweight and unsupervised design</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The baseline model successfully learns normal motion patterns in the scene.</li>
  <li>Predicted frames are slightly blurred, which is expected for prediction-based models.</li>
  <li>Prediction error remains low for normal frames and increases significantly during abnormal events.</li>
  <li>The error curve exhibits clear spikes corresponding to anomalous activities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations Identified</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The model treats all spatial regions equally and lacks a focus mechanism.</li>
  <li>Subtle or localized anomalies may not always produce strong error responses.</li>
  <li>Pixel-level MSE is sensitive to background motion and illumination changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion of Work 1</h3>
<p>
This experiment confirms that the baseline future-frame prediction framework
is functioning correctly and can detect anomalies through prediction error.
However, the absence of a focus mechanism motivates the integration of a
spatio-temporal attention module in the next stage.

<h2>Work 2: Attention-Enhanced Future Frame Prediction (MSE-based)</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate whether incorporating a
spatio-temporal attention mechanism into a future-frame prediction model
improves anomaly detection performance when pixel-level MSE is used as the
anomaly score.
</p>

<h3>Model Architecture</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CNN Encoder for spatial feature extraction</li>
  <li>ConvLSTM for temporal modeling</li>
  <li>Spatio-Temporal Attention module after ConvLSTM</li>
  <li>Decoder for future frame prediction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Training Summary</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dataset: UCSD Ped2 (normal training videos only)</li>
  <li>Sequence Length: 5</li>
  <li>Image Size: 128 × 128 (grayscale)</li>
  <li>Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)</li>
  <li>Epochs: 50</li>
</ul>

<pre>
Epoch 50 Avg Loss: 0.000197
</pre>

<h3>Qualitative Results</h3>
<p>
The attention-enhanced model produces visually sharper future frame predictions.
Moving objects are better preserved, and background regions are more stable
compared to the baseline model.

<h3>MSE Error Curve (Attention Model)</h3>
<p>
The following figure shows the frame-wise prediction error (MSE) on the UCSD Ped2
test set using the attention-enhanced model.
</p>

<img src="images/attention_mse_curve.png" width="800"/>

<h3>Quantitative Results (MSE-based AUC)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Baseline AUC (MSE): <b>0.7141</b></li>
  <li>Attention AUC (MSE): <b>0.6918</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
Although attention improves visual prediction quality, the AUC slightly drops
when using pixel-level MSE. This indicates that MSE is not a reliable anomaly
score for attention-enhanced predictions.
</p>

<img src="images/baseline_vs_attention_mse_auc.png" width="600"/>

<h3>Key Observation</h3>
<p>
Pixel-level reconstruction error fails to capture the representational
improvements introduced by attention. This motivates the need for a more robust
anomaly scoring mechanism.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Work 3: Attention with Feature-Level Anomaly Scoring</h2>

<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
To overcome the limitations of pixel-level MSE, feature-level discrepancy is
introduced as an additional anomaly score while keeping the model architecture
unchanged.
</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p>
Deep features are extracted from the shared CNN encoder for both predicted and
ground-truth frames. The final anomaly score is computed as a weighted
combination of pixel-level and feature-level errors.
</p>

<pre>
Final Anomaly Score = α · Pixel MSE + β · Feature-Level Error
</pre>

<h3>Quantitative Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Baseline + MSE AUC: <b>0.7141</b></li>
  <li>Attention + MSE AUC: <b>0.6918</b></li>
  <li>Attention + Feature-Level Error AUC: <b>0.7753</b></li>
</ul>

<h3>ROC Curve (Attention + Feature-Level Error)</h3>

<h3>ROC Curve Comparison</h3>
<p>
The following figure compares the ROC curves of the baseline model and the
attention-enhanced model with feature-level anomaly scoring.
</p>

<img src="images/baseline_vs_attention_feature_auc.png" width="600"/>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Feature-level error provides a smoother and more discriminative anomaly score.</li>
  <li>Subtle motion anomalies are detected more effectively.</li>
  <li>The combination of attention and feature-level scoring yields the best performance.</li>
  <li>AUC improves by <b>+6.1%</b> over the baseline model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion from Work 3</h3>
<p>
Attention improves feature representations, but feature-level anomaly scoring is
essential to fully exploit this improvement. The proposed framework achieves
significant performance gains on UCSD Ped2 under a proper evaluation protocol.
